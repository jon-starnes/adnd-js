# Character Creation Basics

One of the most fun and important aspects of table top gaming is creating your own character. Your character is your alter ego in the game world, and you can make them as unique and interesting as you want. In Advanced Dungeons and Dragons (AD&D), character creation involves the following steps:

## Race and Class
Choose a race and a class. Your race and class determine your character's physical traits, abilities, skills, and background. For example, if you choose to be an elf wizard, you will have pointy ears, high intelligence, magic spells, and a connection to nature. If you choose to be a human fighter, you will have average features, high strength, martial weapons, and a military training. You can choose from a variety of races and classes in AD&D, such as dwarf, halfling, cleric, thief, etc.

## Name yourself
Choose a name and a personality. Your name and personality give your character life and identity. You can choose a name that suits your character's race and culture, or you can make up your own. You can also choose a personality that reflects your character's goals, motivations, beliefs, and quirks. For example, your character could be brave, curious, loyal, greedy, sarcastic, or anything else you can think of. You can use your personality to guide your actions and interactions in the game.

## Rolling for attributes
Choose your attributes. Your attributes represent your character's numerical abilities and proficiencies. There are six attributes in AD&D: Strength (Str), Dexterity (Dex), Constitution (Con), Intelligence (Int), Wisdom (Wis), and Charisma (Cha). Each attribute has a score ranging from 3 to 18, which affects your character's performance in combat and other situations. For example, if you have high Str, you can deal more damage with melee weapons. If you have low Dex, you might have a lower Armor Class (AC) and be easier to hit.

To determine your attribute scores, you can either roll dice or use a point-buy system. If you roll dice, you roll four six-sided dice (4d6) for each attribute and add up the three highest results. If you use a point-buy system, you start with 75 points and distribute them among your attributes as you wish. However, no attribute score can be lower than 3 or higher than 18 before racial adjustments.

Some races have bonuses or penalties to certain attributes based on their natural abilities. For example, elves have +1 to Dex and -1 to Con. Humans have no bonuses or penalties to any attributes. You should apply these adjustments after determining your attribute scores.

Your attributes also determine some of your secondary characteristics, such as hit points (HP), saving throws (ST), attack rolls (AR), etc. For example, if you have high Con, you will have more HP. If you have high Wis, you will have better ST against spells.

## Appearance and equipment
Choose your equipment and appearance. Your equipment and appearance are the final touches that make your character ready for adventure. Your equipment includes the items and weapons that your character carries or wears, such as armor, swords, potions, etc. Your appearance includes the details that describe how your character looks, such as hair color, eye color, clothing style, etc. You can choose your equipment and appearance based on your race, class, personality, or preference.

Once you have completed these steps, you have created your character! Congratulations! You can now use your character sheet to record all the information about your character and use it during the game. Have fun playing with your character and exploring the game world!
