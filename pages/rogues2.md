## Rogues: Secondary Specialty Classes
In AD&D 2nd edition, there are two core subclasses for Rogues: Thief and BardÂ¹. However, there are also other optional subclasses that were introduced in various supplements and settings, such as:

- **Assassin**: Assassins are rogues who specialize in killing for hire. They have some thief skills, such as move silently, hide in shadows, climb walls, and backstab. They also have some special abilities, such as disguise, poison use, and death attack (a more powerful form of backstab that can instantly kill the target). Assassins must be evil in alignment and belong to a secret guild. They first appeared in the Player's Handbook (1e) (1978) and were later revised in the Complete Thief's Handbook (1992).
- **Scout**: Scouts are rogues who specialize in wilderness exploration and survival. They have some thief skills, such as move silently, hide in shadows, find/remove traps, and backstab. They also have some special abilities, such as tracking, animal lore, camouflage, and evasion (a chance to avoid damage from area effects). Scouts can be of any alignment and do not belong to any organization. They first appeared in the Complete Thief's Handbook (1992).
- **Swashbuckler**: Swashbucklers are rogues who specialize in daring feats of combat and acrobatics. They have some thief skills, such as pick pockets, climb walls, and read languages. They also have some special abilities, such as parry (a chance to deflect attacks with a weapon), taunt (a way to provoke enemies into making mistakes), and improved criticals (a higher chance to deal double damage with a weapon). Swashbucklers tend to be chaotic or neutral in alignment and often belong to a noble or pirate faction. They first appeared in the Complete Thief's Handbook (1992).
- **Acrobat**: Acrobats are rogues who specialize in tumbling and gymnastics. They have some thief skills, such as pick pockets, open locks, find/remove traps, and read languages. They also have some special abilities, such as balance (a way to avoid falling or being knocked down), jump (a way to leap over obstacles or enemies), and tumble (a way to reduce damage from falls or attacks). Acrobats can be of any alignment and often belong to a circus or a thieves' guild. They first appeared in the Complete Thief's Handbook (1992).
- **Bounty Hunter**: Bounty Hunters are rogues who specialize in hunting down fugitives and criminals for a reward. They have some thief skills, such as move silently, hide in shadows, find/remove traps, and backstab. They also have some special abilities, such as capture (a way to restrain or immobilize a target), interrogation (a way to extract information from a target), and tracking (a way to follow a target's trail). Bounty Hunters can be of any alignment and often work alone or for a law enforcement agency. They first appeared in the Complete Thief's Handbook (1992).

These are some of the most common rogue subclasses that were available in AD&D 2nd edition. There may be others that I have not mentioned here. If you want to learn more about them, you can check out the sources that I have referenced below.
