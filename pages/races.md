<h1>Races of the Realm</h1>

<div id="human-race">
  <h2>Human</h2>
    Humans, in the grand tapestry of fantasy realms akin to AD&D, are known for their diversity and resilience. On average, humans have balanced attributes, with no particular affinity or glaring weakness, allowing them the freedom to choose a wide range of professions. Humans are as varied in culture and behavior as the lands they inhabit. From the noble knights of sprawling kingdoms to the nomadic tribes in harsh deserts, each human society is a distinct symphony of traditions, values, and arts. Humans are often driven to achieve greatness quickly, which can make them ambitious and at times, impulsive.
  Humans have no inherent special abilities or bonuses, their true strength lying in their versatility and ability to adapt. However, many game variants offer humans a bonus feat or a small increase to all their attributes to reflect their adaptive nature.
