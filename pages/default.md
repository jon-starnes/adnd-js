# Welcome fellow adventurers!

Welcome to Jon's Adventure Generator, the ultimate site for creating your own table top D&D adventures! Whether you are a fan of fantasy, sci-fi, horror, or anything in between, you can find inspiration and guidance here to craft your own stories and scenarios. You can use our tools to generate characters, locations, plots, items, and more. You can also browse our collection of ready-made adventures that you can download and play with your friends.  

The page navigation is limited now to material to help you get started on rolling your own player character. Start first with the [Races](https://jon-starnes.github.io/adnd-js/races.html) page, then read through the information on [character classes](https://jon-starnes.github.io/adnd-js/classes.html), and [persona alignment](https://jon-starnes.github.io/adnd-js/alignment.html). Lastly read through the process of [character creation](https://jon-starnes.github.io/adnd-js/character-creation.html).
